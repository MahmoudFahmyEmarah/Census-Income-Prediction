## Recommendations

### Data Preprocessing
1. Handle missing values in migration-related features
2. Consider feature engineering for high-cardinality categorical variables
3. Address class imbalance in target variable

### Feature Engineering
1. Create age groups from continuous age variable
2. Combine related categorical features
3. Create interaction features between education and work class

### Model Development
1. Use stratified sampling for cross-validation
2. Apply class balancing techniques
3. Consider ensemble methods for better performance

### Data Leakage Prevention
1. Remove or carefully handle features with high target correlation
2. Validate temporal consistency in features
3. Implement proper train/validation/test splits
